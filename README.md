This is a completely overengineered college project. Below is listed all that was required. I may have gone overboard.

The project you will be prototyping as a command line application in order to flesh out the 
functionality will be a personal income calculator. The application should be simple and intuitive to 
use with all menu choices clearly labelled and requiring no instruction. The application should 
provide the following functionality:
    • Allow users to input their salary (weekly/monthly/yearly) before or after tax
        o Before tax: allow users to input their tax credits and handle the tax deductions 
          then output take home pay based on current Irish tax brackets
        o After tax: allow users to optionally specify their tax for calculation into final report
    • Allow users to input any expenses they may have by specifying a category tag and amount 
    • Display a final ‘report’ detailing the users starting salary, all expenses broken down in 
      categories and a final take home pay showing how much they earn weekly, monthly and 
      yearly
Nice to have extras/Advanced features:
    • The ability to specify custom tax brackets to handle potential non-Irish tax residents to use 
    the application
    • The ability to save the final ‘report’ into a text file
