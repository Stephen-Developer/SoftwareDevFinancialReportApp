This is a completely overengineered college project. Below is listed all that was required. I may have gone overboard.

Personal Income Calculator (Prototype)

This project is a command-line application that serves as a personal income calculator.
It is designed to be simple, intuitive, and menu-driven, requiring no external instructions.
All menu choices are clearly labeled for easy navigation.
